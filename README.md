# Sarvadnya (सर्वज्ञ), an All-Knowing Chatbot!!

Chatbots can be real WoW!! The recent evidence is: ChatGPT. Now that they are more human-like with the latest LLMs (Large Language Models). But these LLMs are Pretrained on their own (HUGE) data. Mere mortals don't have any ways ($$, time, expertise) to train own LLMs. RAG and/or Fine-tuning is the way out for Domain Adaptation ie. LLMs answering on your corpus. This repo is a collection of various [PoCs (Proof-of-Concepts)](./src/README.md) to interface custom data using LLMs. Indic-languages models info is being collected [here](./README_AABB.md)


# What?

## PoCs Projects
- Prep chatbots of various modalities, use cases and domains, diff datasets
- Prep videos, write Medium Posts (GDE/TH), LinkedIn posts, Youtube channel 

# Modes
- Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) on own data
- Fine-tuning LLMs with own data using LoRA etc

## RAG
- When?: {less, streaming, private} data and less {compute, money, expertise}
- What?:
	- on knowledge graphs, more grounding
	- tabular financial data, representation and similarity
	- midcurveNN Geometric serialization and retrieval
	- active loop idea of fine-tuning your data
	- Langchain and Llamaindex with any new LLM


## Fine-Tuning
- When? Sufficient curated date is available, not a whole lot though, in a batch (not running) state
- What: Instead of unstructured text (input prompts) to unstructured text (output response), more value is in prompt to structured output, such as :
	- text2json: many enterprises such as financial companies.
	- text2cypher: for graph databases, from Neo4j, like Langchain implementation by Tomaz Britanic
	- text2SQL: classical case, many pro solutions available, study them, follow them, for other QLs
	- text2Manim: Maths Animation, dataset available, see if generated video can be shown in the same streamlit page
	- text23DJS: Good for 3D+LLM+Agents like Metamorph from Nvidia, Geometry or shape representation as text, is the key
	- textGraph2textGraph: MidcurveNN if we get Graph representation as text, right.
	
- Here, key would be robust post-processing and evaluation as the response needs to be near perfect, no scope of relaxation even in syntax or format.

## Tech Stacks
- Enterprise: Google Doc AI, Vertex AI, Microsoft Azure Language AI Services
- Open Source: Langchain (Serve/Smith/Graph), HuggingFace, Streamlit for UI


## Bottom-line
- `Not looking for Success, but Wonder!!`
- तमसो मा ज्योतिर्गमय : From Dark (hidden in text data) to Light (insights)
